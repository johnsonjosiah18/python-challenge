# Module 3 Challenge

# All coding files are located in python-challenge>PyBank>main and python-challenge>PyPoll>main. 

# For this project we were given two sets of data that required relatively similar tasks of calculating totals, keeping track of greatest increase/decreases, and using list/dictionaries to organize our data and output it as well. 

# PyBank data file summary: Located in python-challenge>pybank>resources>
# This file was provided as a csv file that will be required to be read, and the results should be written to a txt file. 

# Items to calculate - The total number of months included in the dataset. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period. The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period. The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

#PyPoll data file summary:
# This file was provided as a csv file that will be required to be read, and the results should be written to a txt file.

# Items to calculate - The total number of votes cast. A complete list of candidates who received votes .The percentage of votes each candidate won .The total number of votes each candidate won .The winner of the election based on popular vote
